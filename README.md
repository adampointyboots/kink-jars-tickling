# Kink Jars

A single-page questionnaire: pick a color, rate each jar 1–5, save a PNG.
Everything runs in the browser. Nothing is uploaded, and answers are only kept in that person's browser (localStorage) so a refresh doesn't wipe them.

This fork credits [LockedTony's Kink Jars](https://lockedtony.github.io/kink-jars/) both on the page and in every saved image.

## Host it free on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repo (public is required for free Pages) and add `index.html`.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**, pick `main` / `(root)`, Save.
3. After a minute it's live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Netlify Drop or Cloudflare Pages work too: drag the folder in, done.

## Customizing

- **Jar labels:** edit the `JARS` array at the top of the `<script>`. Each entry is a list of label lines. The grid is 7 columns wide and grows rows as needed.
- **Preset colors:** edit `PRESETS`.
- **Overflow looks:** six styles (drips, puddle, foam with popped lid, geyser, splash, hearts), assigned so neighbors never match. Details are seeded per jar, so every friend's sheet is consistent.
